## Short project description: 
For our project, our team chose to use a dataset studying forest fires in Montesinho Natural Park, in northeastern Portugal. Forest fires are responsible for eliminating vegetation and the habitats of many animal species as well as humans, releasing harmful pollutants like carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere. All of these things contribute to global warming, and often particularly harm minority communities who have a greater vulnerability to these fires. But see the project for yourself in order to learn more about the dataset and our findings:
